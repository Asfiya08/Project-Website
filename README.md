# Project-Website
Hello;
This project is made as the starting steps in my web development domain.
This is a birthday themed multipage website. This website consists of 4 pages entitled "B-Day#1","Video","Carousel","Feedback form"<Google form to bypass typescript>. This main feature of this website is how the elements and structures aligned and the linking of webpage highlighting the tab names.
As this was one of my starting steps in webdevelopment so i have done my best to ensure that i imply everything that i have studied from YouTube videos and Books as well,
Hope you like this and do leave a reply in the Feedback formðŸŽ‰ðŸŒ»
